Hello! This is Hem Sai Charan Kottapalli (A00447456), people call me as Hem. My prefered email is Hem.Sai.Charan.Kottapalli@smu.ca . I'm from Hyderabad, India. I have recently graduated (May 2020) from my bachelors in Mechanical Engineernig from KL university, Guntur, India. Well I had few CS courses in my freshmen and sophomore year which dragged my interests towards CS. Coding few challenging problems and solving them gave me joy which I couldn't find in most of my mechanical engineering courses and I wanted to explore more. But I have no experience and exposure into CS much as I also had to manage my main degree so I had to make time for CS. I thought through this program I could have more euphoria and fun so, I'm here. Apart from my puzzled academics I love to do film making stuff. I shoot and edit videos like a ton. I worked as a core coordinator for many events at my university as a lead cinematographer and editor. I would give myself an A+ in film making if I had to. I'm looking forward to get into delightful learning and also capture the essence there with my skills.

I'm familir with c and Python. I'm learning Java so I'm a beginner in it.Also I have a vermuch little exposure in HTML and CSS. Apart from it I have no exposure to any other technologies. I'm looking forward to make myself uncomfortable and play with the project.
